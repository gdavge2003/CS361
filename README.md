# technology-guide-review-website

This project is for CS361 Software Engineering I. The bulk of the coursework involves project managing rather than code implementation, the latter of which is done for the sake of completion.

This is a basic interface of the vision drafted throughout the course: a website where users write guides and reviews for software security services (firewalls, antiviruses, etc.) for other users who are able to purchase said software through the site and review them.
